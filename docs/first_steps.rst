First Steps
===========


Installation
------------

The easiest way to use tinycss2 is to install it in a virtual environment. If
you are not familiar with Python’s virtual environments, please take the time
to read `Python’s documentation`_.

When your virtual environment is activated, you can then install tinycss2 with
pip_::

    pip install tinycss2

This will also automatically install tinycss2’s only dependency, webencodings_.
tinycss2 and webencodings both only contain Python code and should work on any
Python implementation.

tinycss2 also is packaged for many Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora,
Archlinux, Gentoo…).
