tinycss2 is a low-level CSS parser and generator written in Python: it can
parse strings, return objects representing tokens and blocks, and generate CSS
strings corresponding to these objects.

Based on the CSS Syntax Level 3 specification, tinycss2 knows the grammar of
CSS but doesn't know specific rules, properties or values supported in various
CSS modules.
